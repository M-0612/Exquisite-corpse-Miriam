<br />

## What is This? :eye: :lips: :eye:

This is a collaborative collage that lets each contributor add whatever they like. Let's build something weird and unpredictable together!

## How to Contribute :tada:
Feeling creative? Take part in one of the projects below or add your own idea!

### 1. :art: ASCII Art
Contribute to an evolving ASCII Art project! Add your own designs or remix existing ones.
You don't need any fancy tools-just your imagination and a keyboard.

- **Where to contribute:** Head to the *ascii_art/* folder.
- **Rules:** Feel free to modify existing art, but leave some of the original work intact so others can use it.

### 2. :writing_hand: Random Sentence Story
Let's create a story by adding randomly generated sentences that use one noun or adjective used in the previous sentence.
- **Where to contribute:** Check out the *random_sentence_story/* folder and open *story.txt*
- **Rules:** Use your AI of choice to generate one or more random sentences.

### 3. :computer: Creative Coding
Create patterns, shapes or whatever you'd like using code.

- **Where to contribute:** Look into the *creative_coding/* folder
- **Rules:** Add a Python script that generates some form of visual art. Feel free to build on existing contributions or start something new!
